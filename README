DBD::PrimeBase -- DBD module interfacing the PrimeBase database.

   This module is based on the DBD::ODBC, DBD::Oracle and
   DBD::mysql modules.

DESCRIPTION

       The PrimeBase Driver for DBI was created by taking the
       ODBC driver and converting it so that it used the
       PrimeBase API instead of ODBC. The Oracle and mysql DBDs
       were also used as a reference while doing this.

       This is a first pass at the PrimeBase DBD and it is hoped
       that it will be enough to introduce PrimeBase to the Perl
       community. If you find bugs or missing features please
       report them to support@PrimeBase.com or mention them in
       the PrimeBase talk mail list where they will be looked at
       and fixed. To subscribe to the PrimeBase talk mail list

PREREQUISITES

       Perl
           Preferably a version of Perl, that comes pre
           configured with your system. For example, all Linux
           and FreeBSD distributions come with Perl. For Windows,
           ActivePerl is recommended, see
           http://www.activestate.com for details.

       PrimeBase
           The PrimeBase database server and SDK are available
           for download from http://www.PrimeBase.com

           You need not install the actual PrimeBase database
           server, the PrimeBase SDK is sufficient if you have a
           PrimeBase database server running on a separate
           machine.

           Follow the instructions for installing the PrimeBase
           software. The default installation is recommended.

       DBI 
           DBD::PrimeBase is a DBI driver, hence you need DBI. It
           is available from the same source where you got the
           DBD::PrimeBase distribution from.

INSTALLATION

       For installation you need to fetch the DBD::PrimeBase source 
       distribution. The latest version is always available from

         http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/DBD/

       The name is typically something like

         DBD-PrimeBase-1.4001.tar.gz

         gzip -cd DBD-PrimeBase-1.4001.tar.gz | tar xf -



       This will create a sub directory DBD-PrimeBase-1.4001.
       Enter this sub directory and type

         perl Makefile.PL
         make
         make test

       If the tests seem to look fine, you may continue with

         make install (You will need to be root to do this.)

       If the tests fail, you might need to configure some
       settings.

       Configuration

       If you have installed the PrimeBase database server on the
       current machine and have not changed it's default
       published name 'PrimeServer' or the administrator user's
       password, then the default configuration will work. If you
       have altered the default PrimeBase database server
       settings or if the PrimeBase database server is running on
       a different machine then you will have to alter the
       default settings.

       The install script "Makefile.PL" can be configured via a
       lot of switches. All switches can be used on the command
       line. For example, the test database:

         perl Makefile.PL --testdb=<db>

       Available switches are:

       testdb
           Name of the test database, defaults to Perl_test.

           If the database doesn't exist the test scripts will
           create it automatically.

       testuser
           Name of the test user, defaults to Administrator.

       testpassword
           Password of the test user, defaults to empty.

       testhost
           Host name or IP number of the test database server;
           defaults to localhost.

       testserver
           The published name of the PrimeBase database server,
           defaults to PrimeServer.

       The configuration process will create a PrimeBase.env file

       in the test directory 't' and the bench mark directory
       'benchmarks'.

       You can change the PrimeBase database server connection
       settings by editing this file.


Benchmarks

       The PrimeBase DBD includes a selection of the MySQL
       Benchmarks in the directory 'benchmarks'. These benchmarks
       remain true to the originals that are available with the
       MySQL database server with only slight modifications made
       to ensure correct execution using PrimeBase.  Any changes
       made have been documented in the files them selves.

       After building, testing and installing the PrimeBase DBD
       you will be able to run the benchmarks by changing
       directory to 'benchmarks' and executing the benchmarks
       such as:

       perl test-wisconsin

SUPPORT

       For support you should join the PrimeBase Talk mail list.
       To subscribe to the PrimeBase mail list send mail to :
       PrimeBase-Talk-on@lists.imd.net. Once you have joined you
       will have access to the search able PrimeBase Talk
       archive, http://PrimeBase-Talk.imd.net, where you can
       search for postings related to your problem or question.

       If you don't find what you are looking for in the archive
       then post a question to the mail list. The mail list is
       monitored by the developers at SNAP Innovation and you can
       be sure of a quick response if not from someone in the
       PrimeBase development community, then from one of SNAP
       Innovation's developers personally.
